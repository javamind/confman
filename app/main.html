        Do you want to implement continuous delivery or continuous deployment on your own tools ? We were in this
        situation. We had to implement continuous deployment but we did'nt want to use a big solution like Puppet, Chef,
        Go...

        Our need is only to use a simple configuration manager. One repository where all our conf is stocked and no
        other tools to run scripts. For that we usually use Jenkins and our ops wanted to keep their scripts.
        You are in this context ? So Confman is made for you....
